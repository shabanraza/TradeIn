alwasy take action your self when human intervtion is need  regarding changing db realted things

before implementing new thing please take a look our code what we are already using ,use same method  alwasy ask if you are going to use new method of any functionality 

This comprehensive guide outlines best practices, conventions, and standards for development with modern web technologies including ReactJS, NextJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI frameworks.

    Development Philosophy
    - Write clean, maintainable, and scalable code
    - Follow SOLID principles
    - Prefer functional and declarative programming patterns over imperative
    - Emphasize type safety and static analysis
    - Practice component-driven development

    Code Implementation Guidelines
    Planning Phase
    - Begin with step-by-step planning
    - Write detailed pseudocode before implementation
    - Document component architecture and data flow
    - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

    Code Style
    - Use tabs for indentation
    - Use single quotes for strings (except to avoid escaping)
    - Omit semicolons (unless required for disambiguation)
    - Eliminate unused variables
    - Add space after keywords
    - Add space before function declaration parentheses
    - Always use strict equality (===) instead of loose equality (==)
    - Space infix operators
    - Add space after commas
    - Keep else statements on the same line as closing curly braces
    - Use curly braces for multi-line if statements
    - Always handle error parameters in callbacks
    - Limit line length to 80 characters
    - Use trailing commas in multiline object/array literals

    Naming convetion follow existing code base 
  

   

    React Best Practices
    Component Architecture
    - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
    - Define components using the function keyword
    - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
    - Implement proper component composition
    - Use React.memo() strategically for performance
    - Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

    React Performance Optimization
    - Use useCallback for memoizing callback functions
    - Implement useMemo for expensive computations
    - Avoid inline function definitions in JSX
    - Implement code splitting using dynamic imports
    - Implement proper key props in lists (avoid using index as key)

    Next.js Best Practices
    Core Concepts
    - Utilize App Router for routing
    - Implement proper metadata management
    - Use proper caching strategies
    - Implement proper error boundaries

    Components and Features
    - Use Next.js built-in components:
      - Image component for optimized images
      - Link component for client-side navigation
      - Script component for external scripts
      - Head component for metadata
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Use proper data fetching methods

    Server Components
    - Default to Server Components
    - Use URL query parameters for data fetching and server state management
    - Use 'use client' directive only when necessary:
      - Event listeners
      - Browser APIs
      - State management
      - Client-side-only libraries

    TypeScript Implementation
    - Enable strict mode
    - Define clear interfaces for component props, state, and tanstack state structure.
    - Use type guards to handle potential undefined or null values safely.
    - Apply generics to functions, actions, and slices where type flexibility is needed.
    - Utilize TypeScript utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) for cleaner and reusable code.
    - Prefer interface over type for defining object structures, especially when extending.
    - Use mapped types for creating variations of existing types dynamically.

    UI and Styling
    Component Libraries
    - Use Shadcn UI for consistent,forms, accessible component design.
    - Integrate Radix UI primitives for customizable, accessible UI elements.
    - Apply composition patterns to create modular, reusable components.


    

 

  

    Global State
    -TanStack query
    alwasy tanstack for all api calls 


    Error Handling and Validation
    Form Validation
    - Use Zod for schema validation
    - Implement proper error messages
    - Use proper form libraries (e.g., React Hook Form)

    Error Boundaries
    - Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React component trees gracefully.
    - Log caught errors to an external service (e.g., Sentry) for tracking and debugging.
    - Design user-friendly fallback UIs to display when errors occur, keeping users informed without breaking the app.

   

 

    Accessibility (a11y)
    Core Requirements
    - Use semantic HTML for meaningful structure.
    - Apply accurate ARIA attributes where needed.
    - Ensure full keyboard navigation support.
    - Manage focus order and visibility effectively.
    - Maintain accessible color contrast ratios.
    - Follow a logical heading hierarchy.
    - Make all interactive elements accessible.
    - Provide clear and accessible error feedback.

    Security
    - Implement input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
    - Use DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML content.
    - Use proper authentication methods.

    Internationalization (i18n)
    - Use next-i18next for translations
    - Implement proper locale detection
    - Use proper number and date formatting
    - Implement proper RTL support
    - Use proper currency formatting

    Documentation
    - Use JSDoc for documentation
    - Document all public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
    - Add examples when appropriate
    - Use complete sentences with proper punctuation
    - Keep descriptions clear and concise
    - Use proper markdown formatting
    - Use proper code blocks
    - Use proper links
    - Use proper headings
    - Use proper lists
